The Easy Bus Booking project is a handy system made with Python and SQL to make booking bus tickets simple. 
Python helps create an easy-to-use interface where you can book tickets, see schedules, and handle reservations.
SQL comes in the background to store and fetch data efficiently. It keeps track of bookings, passenger info,
and bus schedules. With this system, you can find buses, choose seats, and pay online securely.
SQL also helps to create reports showing ticket sales, earnings, and who's booking tickets,
giving useful insights for business. Together, Python and SQL make sure the bus booking system works smoothly and can grow as needed.
